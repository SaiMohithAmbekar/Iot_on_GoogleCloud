# Iot on GoogleCloud

Computer Networks Research Study on IoT on Google Cloud.

The prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) is growing rapidly with increasing influence on our daily life. IoT has received considerable attention in both academia and industry recently and there has been significant studies on security and privacy aspects of IoT and cyber-physical systems. Researchers in academia have developed novel access control models and mechanisms for IoT. On the industry side, companies including cloud services providers like Microsoft, Amazon and Google have deployed Cloud-Enabled IoT Platforms to ensure wide scale adoption. However, there is a lack of consensus between formal IoT access control models proposed in the literature and real-world Cloud-Enabled IoT deployments.
